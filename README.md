# AnyProxy
A CSharp library that can proxy any object allowing you to add properties or interceptors to any existing class.

## Description
AnyProxy allows you to add your own properties, an interface, or interceptors for existing methods on a class. 
You may want to do this if you can't extend a class to include the data you want or if you only want it available at runtime.
